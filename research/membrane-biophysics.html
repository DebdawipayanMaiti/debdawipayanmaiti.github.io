<h1>Cell Membrane Biophysics & Fluctuation Analysis</h1>

<h2>Research Motivation</h2>
<p>
This project aimed to understand how mechanical properties and thermal fluctuations govern
cell membrane behavior, particularly during host–pathogen interactions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Theoretical Modeling</h2>
<p>
Membranes were modeled using the Canham–Helfrich Hamiltonian. A harmonic approximation was
used to study thermal fluctuations and extract parameters such as bending rigidity and
surface tension. Protein–membrane interactions were incorporated into simulations.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Microscopy & Fluctuation Analysis</h2>
<p>
Phase-contrast microscopy was used to measure real-time membrane fluctuations in untreated
interphase cells. Fluctuations were decomposed into spatial and temporal modes, and power
spectral density maps were generated.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Imaging Resolution & Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
Epifluorescence microscopy was used to estimate imaging resolution via point spread function
and FWHM analysis of fluorescent beads. Additional image analysis included kymographs and
retraction speed calculations from live-cell TIFF stacks.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Scientific Outcome</h2>
<p>
This project strengthened my ability to connect theory with experiment and provided insight
into how membrane mechanics regulate cellular response to external perturbations.
